# CSF425_DL_Assignment

## Problem Statement:


In this assignment we will explore the impact of
Skip Connections in Multi Layer Perceptron networks. Your tasks are to -
1. Compare the performance of MLPs with skip connections to those without skip
connections.

2. Analyse multiple different types of skip connections (at least 2) and compare their
performance.

3. Perform ablation studies over different (at least 2) characteristics of skip connections
(e.g. number of layers skipped) to see how this effects performance.

4. BONUS: Attempt to explain, through an experiment of your own, why Skip Con-
nections help or hurt.
